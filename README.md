# film-app
Tutorial app project from Udacity using film database.

TODO/Refactor list:

- Using ASyncTask for fetching data in background is not really recommended. Use services?
- Fetching data from server is done in really "vanilla" way. Switch to Retrofit library?
- Add some settings to the Settings activity. Switch to night mode?

LAYOUT:
- Improve main grid view - use card view?
- Improve MovieDetails activity - add viewing trailer, proper "title" labels, parsing date string and "share" button.
- Add navigation drawer to the app - then enable ability to fetch movie by cinema/TV show, genre etc.
